DESX ALGORITHM 

Overview:
The DesX algorithm is a cryptographic algorithm implementation for data encryption and decryption. It is built upon the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, enhancing its security through additional operations including XOR transformations.

Usage:
The DesX algorithm provides methods for both encryption and decryption of data. It requires three keys for operation: keyInternal, keyDes, and keyExternal.

Installation:
Ensure that the project.Model.crypto.algorithm package containing the DesX class is included in your Java project. Additionally, make sure you have the necessary dependencies and imports for the classes and methods used within the algorithm.

Important Notes:
Ensure that the keys provided are of appropriate length and securely generated.
Use the algorithm responsibly and consider additional security measures for sensitive data.
